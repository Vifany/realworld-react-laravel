> ### Laravel+React codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Laravel+React** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

Project in subject, being implemented outside of original community, and follows only technical parts of guidlelines, best practices and specifications.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.


#### Current state of project:
In current state `main` branch contains "minimal viable prduct" of backend API, compliant with specs.
All API routes are covered by tests for most basic scenarios using PHPunit+pest.
Backend part is yet to be prepared for mock deployment and is subject to change.

#### Planned goals
* Build and deliver minimal frontend
* Bring backend into stricter compliance to declared specs
* Make project ready for "deployment/installation"
